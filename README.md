# HR13-First-Timers-Track

## Inspiration
As international students at Rice University, we face immense pressure, both academically and in our daily lives. Music has become a primary tool for us to destress. Studies have consistently shown that music can significantly improve well-being and reduce stress. Before participating in RiceHacker13, three out of our four team members had never used Discord. We found certain aspects of it challenging to understand, possibly due to minor language and cultural barriers. Consequently, we were driven to create a platform accessible to users of all languages. Recognizing the profound impact of music and the potential of artificial intelligence, our team embarked on a journey to create the AIMusicBot for Discord. Our vision was to integrate the joy of music with the convenience of Discord, offering a more engaging and enjoyable user experience.

## What it does
AIMusicBot is not just a Discord bot; it's a musical experience tailored to individual preferences. It leverages the power of AI to make personalized song recommendations based on user inputs. Whether you're in the mood for songs by a particular artist, looking for tracks that match your current emotions, or even imagining a specific scene and wanting a song that fits, AIMusicBot has got you covered. Moreover, it's multilingual capabilities ensure that the joy of music is accessible to users across different linguistic backgrounds.

## Features:

## How we built it
AIMusicBot is a culmination of innovative design, technical proficiency, and user-centric approach. Our Chatbox Interface is structured to request and parse user input efficiently, leveraging the capabilities of the Generative Pretrained Transformer 3.5 Turbo API. For the Music Bot Interface, we designed commands that seamlessly integrate with Discord's functionality, ensuring an intuitive user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Bringing the AIMusicBot to life has been a journey of discovery, learning, and achievement. We're especially proud of the multilingual capabilities, ensuring music is accessible to all. The fact that we've been able to create a tool that not only enhances the Discord experience but also contributes to users' well-being is immensely satisfying.

## What we learned
From understanding the nuances of the Discord platform to exploring the vast potential of AI in music recommendation, our learning curve has been steep and rewarding. Collaborating as a team, we've also honed our problem-solving, brainstorming, and project management skills.

## What's next for AIMusicBot
We envision AIMusicBot as a continually evolving tool. We aim to expand its functionality, making it more interactive and responsive to user preferences. We also see the potential of this bot being adopted in communities beyond Discord, possibly in other social platforms or digital spaces.
