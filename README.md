# HR13-First-Timers-Track-GPTmusicBot

## Track Description
Discord is an instant messaging platform that quickly evolved into a general communications app with hundreds of millions of users. One of the main features of Discord is the ability to add “bots” to servers – collections of persistent text and voice channels – that can provide utilities ranging from moderation assistance to implementations of simple games.

## Project Description
Inspired by various music bot in Discord, we want to build a special, brand new GPTmusicBot. This bot can recommend you music based on your current emotions and feelings. The music_cog.py file implements all music related functions, such as play, plause, resume, music queue and so on. The chatBot.py calls open-source ChatGPT API and implements reading, understanding, and responding as a chatting robot by natural language processing.
